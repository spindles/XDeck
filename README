XDeck v0.1

XDeck is a suite of software that I created for use in simulating a cyberdeck interface for the SINtax Cyberpunk Live Roleplaying system (www.sintaxlrp.com).

It is free software licensed under the GPL v2 license in the hope that someone will find it useful.

The project page can be found on github at https://github.com/spindles/XDeck
