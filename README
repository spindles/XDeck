XDeck v0.1 - (C) 2010/11 Spindles (spindles@wonkyspanner.com)  

XDeck is a suite of software that I created for use in simulating a cyberdeck interface for the SINtax Cyberpunk Live Roleplaying system (www.sintaxlrp.com).

It is free software licensed under the GPL v2 license and released in the hope that someone will find it useful.

The project page can be found on github at https://github.com/spindles/XDeck

Dependencies:
qt5
festival-devel
festival
opencv
libv4l-dev
ARToolkit

Compilation instructions

Run the following commands to compile the XDeck software:

qmake XDeck.pro
make

You will then have two executables: cwizard and xconnect. You must run cwizard before you try to run xconnect.
